# ophelus

A software that tracks projects, progress

# notes on previous vigama projects for tracking purposes

vigama-buildspace: literally a create-react-app with task and tasklist
vigama-v1: a next.js project with a timer, and some backend models and configs (small) (the ONLY potential project to fork based, but even then i can just create a new one)
vigama-v2: literally just a next.js template
vigama: literally just a readme
vigama-alpha: literally just a playground
